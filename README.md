# Xamarin Note Taking App

This is the Xamarin Note Taking App, explored in the Xamarin 101 Tutorials, and expanded upon here. The original project can be found in [this repository](https://github.com/codemillmatt/xamarin-101), and the tutorials can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JH8ekYJrFHs&list=PLdo4fOcmZ0oU10SXt2W58pu2L0v2dOW-1). I hoped to get a better grip with Xamarin by expanding the C# based note taking app built in the tutorial, adding more features and better styling it to my tastes.
